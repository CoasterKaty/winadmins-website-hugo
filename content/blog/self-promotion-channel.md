Hi WinAdmins!  You might have noticed the new #shameless-self-promotion channel in the General section. 

We'd love to hear about what you've been doing that you want to shamelessly brag about to the community. This can be technology related (`@Psychodata` showing off his new adaptive cards module), something in your personal life (`@SysBehr@cachemeoutside` and `@Angry Missy (she/they)` in their gardens), or maybe you just want to show off your new blog post or tweet.

We ask that you refrain from discussion in this channel (tag the creator in an appropriate channel to talk about it), and so we're setting a six hour slow mode.
