Hello and, again, welcome to the WinAdmins occasional monthly computer-aided patch cycle. It's been a while, hasn't it?

## New Website

Thanks to `@acc`, `@Chris Kibble (He/Him)`, and `@krbtgt`, we have a new website based on Hugo and Markdown! The site is accessible via the same URL, https://winadmins.io/, and is managed via GitHub Pages, meaning anyone can contribute! We have also added a Help page that documents the various commands and roles available, and a Rules page to make our community rules a bit more public.

## Server Changes

* The `#rules` channel has been renamed to `#information`, and the previous rules post replaced with an informational post that links to our new Rules and Help pages, along with links to our external presences.
* [Membership Screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ) has been enabled for new members that join the server.

## Bot Changes

* [MonitoRSS](https://monitorss.xyz/) has been added, and feeds added to the `#papercut`, `#patch-my-pc`, and `#psappdeploytoolkit` channels for updates/new releases. Three new roles have been added that will receive notifications from new posts. Please see the new Notifications role menu in `#roles` to join these roles.
* [DMDb](https://github.com/discord-movie-database/DMDb) has been added to the #entertainment channel per UserVoice #17.

## Previous Changes

* UserVoice #18: `#linux` channel created under the Systems Admin category.
* UserVoice #20: `#movies-and-tv` channel renamed to `#entertainment`, to be more inclusive of all things entertainment (excluding `#games` and `#music`).
* UserVoice #21: `#finance` channel created under the Off Topic category.
