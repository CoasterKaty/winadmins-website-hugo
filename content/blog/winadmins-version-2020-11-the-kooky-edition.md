## Other Changes

* Off-topic channel and Helper role menus have been migrated to our newer, self-hosted bot. To remove a previously added role, you will need to react and unreact.
* Timezone selection has been converted to a role menu, and the previous commands retired.
* `#osd` has been renamed to `#os-deployment`, to match `#app-deployment`.
* The `OSD Helpers` role has been retired.
* A new Helper role has been created, `SQL Helpers`.
* The `?callmods` command has been replaced with `-callmods`. Please use this command in any channel to notify the Moderator team of any problems/issues.
