Hello and, again, welcome to the WinAdmins monthly computer-aided patch cycle.

## Server Raids

Recently, the community was targeted again by a mass raid of spam accounts. On March 3rd, at around 09:00 UTC, roughly 100 accounts joined the server, for the sole purpose of sending members cryptocurrency scam messages via DM. All of these accounts were about an hour and a half old. This is the third time an incident like this has occurred in the past four months. After looking at Server Insights, we have concluded that the source of these attacks is via an invite link. The only location where we have an active invite link is the DISBOARD bot (all of our public-facing presences and redirects utilize the vanity URL).

In order to help prevent these issues from occurring in the future, we have made the decision to remove the DISBOARD bot from the server. We know that a lot of you enjoy "bumping" the server as a form of "game", but we feel that it's in the best interest of the community to remove it. In order to replace it...

## Counting!

Thanks to `@JordanTheITGuy (he/him)`, we now have a new `#counting` channel where you can finally learn how to count! Try to get as high as you can! But make sure to follow the rules! We plan on updating this feature in the future with other fun suprises, so be on the lookout for future updates!
