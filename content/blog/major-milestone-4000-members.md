Congratulations to the WinAdmins User Group Discord community which passed 4,000 members!  Some fun facts:

* This is over 1,000 new sign-ups since our migration from Slack just over a year ago.
* Over the past several months, we've had about 40% of our membership communicate over Discord through chat.
* Over 50,000 messages are sent every months across our channels.
* In September, there were over 6,000 "speaking minutes" in our voice channels.
* More than 100 people showed up for our first ever Live User Group Event in September 2020.

On behalf of the admin team and all of the moderators, thanks for coming and for sticking around. We really feel like we've made some huge changes to help make this an awesome and welcoming community and we hope you agree. To everyone who hangs out in the channels helping other members with Configuration Manager, Intune, PowerShell, etc., we couldn't do it without you and we love you all. In a platonic way. Mostly.

Cheers üç∫
