We maintain a list of events in the `#events` channel of our Discord server, where you can mark yourself as attending, and get a notification from our bot as a reminder.

If you would like to suggest an event to be added, please ping the `@Admin` role in the relevant channel, or in the `#community` channel, with any pertinant information related to it. If you are a Microsoft employees or Trusted Vendor, you can create events yourself; please see the pinned message in the `#events` channel for assistance.

While every attempt is made to keep an accurate calendar, please connect with event organizers to ensure correct dates, times, and registration information.
